I worked on this page to gain knowledge and practice what I am learning in class.  I had some difficulties knowing which periods to erase in the .css file. With trial and error , I was able to figure it out.
These are the changes I made.
Changed to Header HTML Semantic from Div 
Changed to section HTML Semantic from Div

Fixed search engine optimization link by adding id and class
Changed to aside HTML Semantic from Div
